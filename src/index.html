                <h2>Film Classic</h2>
                <p>Gone with the Wind is a 1939 American epic historical romance film, 
                    adapted from Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel of the same name. 
                    The film was produced by David O. Selznick of Selznick International 
                    Pictures and directed by Victor Fleming. Set in the American South against the backdrop of 
                    the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era, the film tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, 
                    the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner. It follows her romantic 
                    pursuit of Ashley Wilkes, who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and her subsequent 
                    marriage to Rhett Butler. The leading roles are played by Vivien Leigh (Scarlett), Clark Gable (Rhett), 
                    Leslie Howard (Ashley), and Olivia de Havilland (Melanie).
                 </p>
                 <p>Production was difficult from the start. Filming was delayed for two years because 
                     of Selznick's determination to secure Gable for the role of Rhett Butler, and the "search for Scarlett" 
                     led to 1,400 women being interviewed for the part. The original screenplay was written by Sidney Howard 
                     and underwent many revisions by several writers in an attempt to get it down to a suitable length. 
                     The original director, George Cukor, was fired shortly after filming began and was replaced by Fleming, who
                    in turn was briefly replaced by Sam Wood while Fleming took some time off due to exhaustion.

                    <h3>Part 1 - American Civil War</h3>
                    <p>On the eve of the American Civil War in 1861, Scarlett O'Hara lives at Tara, her family's cotton plantation 
                       in Georgia, with her parents and two sisters and their many slaves. Scarlett learns that Ashley Wilkes—whom 
                       she secretly loves—is to be married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and the engagement is to be announced the 
                       next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation Twelve Oaks.
                        </p>
                     <p>At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately declares her feelings to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding 
                        hat he and Melanie are more compatible. Scarlett is incensed when she discovers another guest, Rhett Butler, has 
                        overheard their conversation. The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration of war and the men rush to enlist. As 
                        Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her. Although she does 
                        not love him, Scarlett consents and they are married before he leaves to fight.
